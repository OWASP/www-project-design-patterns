OWASP Foundation Web Respository

Design Patterns permits the search of a series of web applications/sites for specific 
patterns which may occur anywhere within the HTTP transaction with the web server. The idea is
to permit attackers and defenders to rapidly check a series of resources for specific patterns 
which may occur in code, response headers, text, or dynamic content.

An example would be to find all login pages on a series of sites, the use of localstorage in
all site javascript resources, or specific patterns which may identify the web framework(s)
in use.
