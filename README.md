OWASP Foundation Web Respository

Design Patterns permits the rapid search of a series of web applications/sites for specific 
patterns which may occur anywhere within the transaction with the web site. The concept is to
permit attackers and defenders to rapidly check a series of resources for specific patterns 
which may occur in code, request/response headers, text, or specific scripting languages 
used on the site. 

An example would be to find all login pages on a series of sites, the use of localstorage in
all site javascript resources, or specific patterns which may identify the web framework(s)
in use.
